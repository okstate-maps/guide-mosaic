## Introduction
Mosaic datasets allow you to easily work with large collections of raster and image data. These datasets can be created in ArcPro and make data management simple.

#### Photoshop
When working with black and white images, it is important to make sure they are all in Grayscale. If they are not, this can be changed. We will start with one image to create an action and use this action to complete the rest.

1. Open photoshop and add one of the images you are using for the mosaic.
2. Select the *Windows* tab on the toolbar and click **Actions**.
